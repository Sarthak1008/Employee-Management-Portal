# Employee-Management-Portal
.Net project for Managing Employee Data

This project is a .NET application for managing employee data using CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. It utilizes SQL Express as the database, Entity Framework for data access, and EF Migrations for managing database schema changes. Here's a brief overview of the project:

Technology Stack:

.NET Framework or .NET Core: The project can be developed using either of these frameworks.
SQL Server Express: A lightweight edition of SQL Server used as the database engine.
Entity Framework (EF): An object-relational mapping (ORM) framework that simplifies data access by mapping database tables to .NET objects.
EF Migrations: A feature of Entity Framework that enables the management and deployment of database schema changes.
Database Design:

CRUD Operations:

Create: Allow users to add new employee records to the database by providing relevant details through a user interface or API endpoint.
Read: Retrieve employee data from the database based on various criteria, such as employee ID, name, or department. Implement search and filtering functionality.
Update: Enable users to modify existing employee records by updating their information.
Delete: Allow users to remove employee records from the database.
User Interface:

Develop a user-friendly interface for interacting with the application, including forms for adding, editing, and deleting employee records.

Perform data operations such as data retrieval, modification, and deletion using Entity Framework's LINQ queries.

Integration with Entity Framework and EF Migrations:
Utilize Entity Framework to establish a connection with the SQL Express database.
Implement Entity Framework migrations to manage database schema changes and versioning.
Use code-first or database-first approaches to generate entity classes and database schema based on your project requirements.
